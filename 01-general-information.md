# Chapter 1: General Information

## (A) Overview of Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT)

### Background

The Community Disputes Resolution Act (CDRA) creates a new statutory tort of interfering with the enjoyment or use of places of residence. The underlying principle is that no person should cause unreasonable interference with his neighbour’s enjoyment or use of that neighbour’s place of residence.

The CDRA also establishes the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) as part of the State Courts to hear cases under the CDRA.

The CDRA only applies to acts committed on or after the date it came into force (1 October
2015).

### Who is my neighbour?

/</Insert picture here/>

Your neighbour is a person who:

- Lives in the same building as you; or
- Lives within a 100 metre radius of your place of residence.

Your neighbour does NOT include a person who lives in the same place of residence as you. 

### Examples of interference

## (B) Before filing a Claim – Self-help remedies

Neighbours should consider starting proceedings in the CDRT only after all self-help options, including community mediation, have been attempted and exhausted.

Initiating proceedings in the CDRT against your neighbour should always be the last option unless all other means of resolving the dispute have not been effective.

To better understand the self-help options that are available to you, you may wish to refer to the following websites:

## (D) Features of CDRT

The CDRA prescribes certain unique features for proceedings in the CDRT which are meant to simplify the processes, ensures that fees are affordable and enables members of the public to represent themselves in the proceedings without the assistance of lawyers.

### PRE-FILING ASSESSMENT

A plaintiff is required to log on to the State Courts online electronic filing system (“CJTS”) at website [www.statecourts.gov.sg/CJTS/](www.statecourts.gov.sg/CJTS/) and undergo a pre-filing assessment before lodging any claim. 

### PRESENT YOUR OWN CASE

Lawyers are not allowed to represent a party to the proceedings (section 29(3)). The only exception is when all parties to the proceedings agree for a party to be represented by a lawyer and the CDRT gives permission (section 29(3)(b)). 

As a general rule, a party to the proceedings must present his or her own case during the CDRT proceedings (section 29(1)). There are, however, some exceptions to this general rule. A party to the proceedings may be represented by another person in the following situations, provided that the CDRT is satisfied that the person has sufficient knowledge of the case and sufficient authority to bind the party whom he represents (section 29(5)):

```
SITUATION

The party is below 21 years old; and The CDRT is of the opinion that he is unable to present his own case. (Section 29(2)(a))

Who can represent the party?

- The party’s parent; 
- The party’s guardian; or 
- A person who is approved by the  CDRT.
```

```
SITUATION

The party is not living in Singapore; and the party is unable to remain in Singapore until the hearing of the case. (Section 29(2)(b))  

Who can represent the party?

A person: 
- who is authorised in writing by the party; and 
- who is approved by the CDRT.
```

```
SITUATION

The CDRT is of the opinion that the party is unable to present his own case because he is:

-  old;
- illiterate;
- mentally ill; or
- physically ill. 
(Section 29(2)(c))

Who can represent the party?

- A person who is authorised in writing by the party; or
- A person who is approved by the CDRT.
```

### PRIVATE PROCEEDINGS

All proceedings in the CDRT are heard in camera (section 22(1)). This means that only the parties to the proceedings and the witnesses who have been called to give evidence in the proceedings are allowed to be present. Unless the Tribunal Judge orders otherwise, the following persons are not allowed to be present during the proceedings:

> a. Members of the press;

> b. Members of the public; and

> c. Immediate family members, relatives and friends of the parties to the proceedings who are not parties to the proceedings and have not been called to give evidence in the proceedings.

### SIMPLIFIED EVIDENTIAL RULES

The CDRT is not bound by the rules of evidence but may inform itself on any matter in such manner as it thinks fit (section 23(1)).

Evidence tendered to the CDRT by or on behalf of a party to any proceedings need not be given on oath but the CDRT may, at any stage of the proceedings, require that the evidence or any part of it be given on oath whether orally or in writing (section 23(2)), or be verified by statutory declaration (section 23(4)).

### SIMPLIFIED METHODS OF SERVICE

Documents that are used in the CDRT proceedings can be served on the other party in the following simplified ways:

| METHOD OF SERVICE | EXPLANATION |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Personal service | Handing the documents to the party to be served |
| Registered post to the residential address, registered address or address of the person’s principal place of business, as notified to ACRA | Posting the documents to the address of the party to be served |
| By submitting through the electronic system | Serving electronically via the Community Justice & Tribunals System (CJTS) where the other party has been notified of the right to access CJTS |
|As directed by the CDRT | In a manner that is directed by the CDRT |

### COMPULSORY COUNSELLING AND MEDIATION

At any point during the proceedings, the CDRT can order parties to the proceedings to attend counselling by a court counsellor or external counsellor, or mediation at the Community Mediation Centre or before any other mediator. A party who fails to comply with the order to attend counselling or mediation commits contempt of court, and may be fined or imprisoned.

### COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS

Other than disbursements, the CDRT will generally not grant costs to or award costs against any party to any proceedings in the CDRT
(section 25). The only exception is where:

> a) The whole or any part of a claim is struck out or dismissed on the ground that the whole or part of the claim is frivolous or vexatious or is an abuse of the process of the CDRT; or

> b) The CDRT is of the view that it is just and equitable to do so. 

**2-Year Limitation Period for Claims**

All CDRT claims must be filed within 2 years from the date the cause of action accrued (section 17(3)). A cause of action is the fact
or facts which entitles you, in law, to start a court action against the neighbour respondent. You may file a claim in the civil courts, e.g. at the Magistrate’s courts if the cause of action accrued more than 2years ago.

**Maximum $20,000 Monetary Claims**

The maximum monetary claim that can be brought in the CDRT is $20,000 (section 17(5)). You may file a claim in the civil courts, e.g. at the Magistrate’s courts if you are claiming more than $20,000 from the neighbour respondent.
